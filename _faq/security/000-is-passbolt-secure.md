Passbolt is currently considered as "stable" and has already undergone several security audits.
It is used by thousands of companies that trust it for storing their passwords. The strict end-to-end and asymmetric encryption model, associated with the robustness of OpenPGP ensure that the solution implements some of the best known standards in terms of security.
However, the answer to whether you should store critical information with it depends on your security level requirements. 

We will publish soon a white paper explaining passbolt security model in depth. Until then, you are welcome to contact us directly and ask your questions.
