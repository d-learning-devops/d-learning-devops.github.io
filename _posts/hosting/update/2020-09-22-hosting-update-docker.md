Every passbolt release comes with a container release. Passbolt containers have a image tag that contains
the passbolt version so updating them is as easy as changing the image tag.

Of course depending on your container scheduler, or docker-compose you might need to restart the stack or perform
some extra steps that are out of the scope of this help site.

As a example if you are running passbolt docker using the docker-compose files provided [here](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
you would just need to change the following line:

```
 image: passbolt/passbolt:<IMAGE_TAG>-debian
```

Where <IMAGE_TAG> is the passbolt version that you want to use, for example `2.13.5` and relaunch your composer:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
