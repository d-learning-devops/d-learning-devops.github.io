    <strong>Do not set a passphrase or an expiration date</strong>
    The php-gnupg module does not support using passphrase at the moment. Make sure you do not set a passphrase.
    Similarly do not set an expiration date. Otherwise all your users will need to
    perform an account recovery when you will eventually need to update the key.
