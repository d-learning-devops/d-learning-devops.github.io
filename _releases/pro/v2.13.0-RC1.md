The team is pleased to announce that the much awaited folders feature is available for testing as part of 
this release candidate.

The goal of folders is to provide a tool for passbolt users to easily organize passwords. The users will be 
able to use nested folders (or directories), in a way that is familiar to what they are used to, for example 
in a fashion that is similar to a file system or a password manager like Keepass.

    legend="Folders in action!"
%}

Passbolt being a collaboration tool, this feature also allows setting permissions on folders, and greatly 
facilitates sharing of resources as well as subfolders. For example, if you select a folder and create a 
resource / folder within it, it will reuse the permissions of the folder. Similarly, permissions of the 
parent folder will be applied when you move items inside the folder. Moreover, inherited permissions will 
be removed when you move items out.

In the next few weeks, we will release more content to explain the advanced behaviors of the feature and 
all the possibilities it offers. In the meantime, you can have a look at the original specifications for 
[more information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pSR97b5emJH5XxMME_lN4CqLUfYFuDw6DGCMJ_XjF-o/edit?usp=sharing).

## How to test this release

{% include messages/warning.html
    content="This is a release candidate. Test it before rolling it out in production."
%}

Some of the features in this release are experimental, so while they were tested with great care, 
they may not be completely free of bugs or performance issues. 
We advise you not to test this release into your production environment, 
but to create a separate dedicated environment to test the feature.

It is possible to test this release by switching to the development branch of the code base, by running 
the following on your server in your passbolt directory:
```
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```

From there, you can follow the regular procedure from the 
[update documentation](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/update).

You can provide us with bug reports on github, and provide us feedback about the feature on the 
[community forum](https://community.passbolt.com) or by contacting us at 
[contact@passbolt.com](mailto:contact@passbolt.com). 

## What else is new?

### Email digests

Another new functionality is the email digest functionality: it will combine email notifications of the same 
kind into one single message. So, it will group similar emails for a given user, for a given time period 
(the frequency of passbolt email cronjob) or when a volume limit is reached. This will help reduce the 
email notifications, especially when you import/share a lot of passwords at once.

{% include articles/figure.html
    url="/assets/img/help/2020/05/rc1/digest.png"
    legend="An example of digest with two deleted resources."
%}

You can enable this feature by switching the following line in your server crontab:.
`/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake EmailQueue.sender`

To
`/var/www/passbolt/bin/cake Passbolt/emailDigest.sender`

You can also test the feature by calling it directly in the command line on your server.

### Server key rotation
It is now possible to extend an expired server key and have the user accept the new server key without 
performing an account recovery. When the key change, the user will be prompted to accept the new one.

    url="/assets/img/help/2020/05/rc1/keychange.png"

### Migration to react

Part of the work done with this release includes some major refactoring of the front end code 
as part of the migration process to React. So, you will see some other visual changes for example, 
when loading the share dialog.

You can expect more visual changes in the upcoming releases.


## Whatâ€™s next?

Unless there are any major roadblocks, we will be publishing a stable version with the Folder feature in June, 
with possibly some behavioral changes and bug fixes requested by the early testers. It will also include 
some other interesting features such as advanced reports. 

Another interesting feature will be the release of a debian package for passbolt server next week. 
We will post more information about it soon.

Thank you for your support and stay safe!
