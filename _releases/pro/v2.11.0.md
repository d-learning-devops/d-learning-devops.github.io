Passbolt v2.11 is maintenance release containing security fixes. Extension update will be rolled out 
automatically to your users like usual, but as an administrator you will need to update your server.

    the minor [update documentation](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/update) to roll out this new version as soon as possible."

The security issues were discovered by security researcher Ren√© Kroka as part of the Bug Bounty program 
organized in collaboration with [YesWeHack](https://yeswehack.com/). You can find more information about 
the vulnerabilities found during this audit, on the 
[dedicated incident page](https://www.passbolt.com/incidents/20190807_multiple_vulnerabilities). 
You can also learn more about passbolt security in our recently published 
[Security White Paper](https://help.passbolt.com/assets/files/Security%20White%20Paper%20-%20Passbolt%20Pro%20Edition.pdf).

This release also includes some requested fixes by the community. The autofill functionality is now a 
bit more robust and will work on more websites, including for example when the login form is located 
in an iframe (on the same domain than the current page). Feel free to report any issues you encounter 
with the autofill on websites you use via [github issues](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_browser_extension).
Another long awaited fix relates to the passphrase remember me and the auto logout functionalities.

The Multi-factor authentication behavior was also adjusted. Passbolt will now ask users to be verified 
at every login using one of the provider you selected, instead of such verification being valid for 72h 
by default. For Yubikey and TOTP you can additional request to be remembered for 30 days on the selected 
device. 

The installation script now also supports the new Debian 10 (stable). Because of this we will soon 
deprecate support for 7.0 (which was still the default on Debian 9). Make sure you upgrade your web 
server to use at least 7.2 in the coming weeks.

Next stop: Folders! We know you are all waiting patiently for the release of folders. We encountered 
some delay with the private launch of Passbolt Cloud, but we are still aiming to release a first version 
before the end of the summer. In that regards we will soon share some specifications and a survey with 
the community to gather feedback and help us finalize the specifications and design.

If you want to receive an invitation for Passbolt Cloud, feel free to complete 
[this form](https://www.passbolt.com/contact/passbolt-cloud-enterprise) or send us an 
email at [sales@passbolt.com](mailto:sales@passbolt.com). Or you can wait for the public launch in September!

The team wish you happy holidays, if you are lucky enough to take some!
