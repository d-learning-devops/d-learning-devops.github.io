It also includes an upgrade to CakePHP v3.7.7 which includes a security fix for CVE-2019-11458. 
The vulnerability affects applications that open malicious serialized content. In passbolt context that would mean
that an attacker with direct write access to the database could craft a malicious serialized email, and 
overwrite any file the web server has write access to. It is not a high-risk scenario, but we still advise you
to upgrade as soon as possible.
