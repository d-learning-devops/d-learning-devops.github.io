The team is pleased to announce that the much awaited "Folders" feature is available to Passbolt Pro and Passbolt Cloud
subscribers as part of this release. Most of the improvements for this release are fixing issues reported by the community,
from the release candidate that was released a few weeks ago. 

Thank you to everyone who helped us test and iron out the last kinks!

Another notable change: as part of this release we upgraded the OpenPGP.js. This may be a breaking change 
if you are using old OpenPGP keys with unsecure 2-byte hash. If you use such a key we advise you to try to 
re-export your private key from GnuPG to produce a more secure hash and perform an account recovery.

    the minor [update documentation](https://help.passbolt.com/hosting/update) to roll out this new version."
