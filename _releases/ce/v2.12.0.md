This release is mainly a maintenance release. It ships with several fixes, mainly regarding the web extension. 
The previously published extension version contained some security fix for an issue in the quick access suggestion system reported by security researcher Rene Kroka. 
You can learn more about it on the [incident page](https://www.passbolt.com/incidents).

It also ships with a much demanded improvement: the possibility to resend a new invitation to a user.

We hope youâ€™ll enjoy this update!

**What next?** The team focus is currently on the upcoming folders feature. 
It is taking a substantial amount of energy to implement but the result should be matching your expectations.
It is now a matter of weeks before the feature is available. If you are interested to know how it will work, you can have a look at [the specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pSR97b5emJH5XxMME_lN4CqLUfYFuDw6DGCMJ_XjF-o/edit?usp=sharing) (feedback is welcome).
The screenshot below will give you a glimpse of its look and feel:
