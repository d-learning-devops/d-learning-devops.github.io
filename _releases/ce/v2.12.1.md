This is a small maintenance release in order to update to jQuery v3.5. The library released an important security fix 
that could potentially result to an XSS in certain Passbolt setups where Content Security Policy (CSP) was disabled by 
the user. You can learn more about the issue  [here](https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/).

Passbolt team is currently busy finalizing a release candidate with some new major features. You can learn more about 
it in our last [blog post](https://www.passbolt.com/blog).

We hope you are safe.
