This release ships with some nice improvements, notably the apparition of the administration dashboard for the Community Edition. 
This dashboard only contains one section for now: email notification settings. 
However, some more sections will appear in the next releases as the idea is to remove completely 
the pain point of configuration through files.

    legend="Email notifications configuration screen"
%}

Another improvement is the possibility to browse passwords using filters in the browser extension “quick access”. 
The filters that were already accessible through the web UI are now available in the “quick access”: Favorites, Items I own, Recently modified, Shared with me or even Groups. 
Check it out.

%}

We hope you’ll enjoy this update!
