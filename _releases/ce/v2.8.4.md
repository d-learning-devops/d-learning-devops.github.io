This release is mainly a maintenance release. It ships with more performance improvements and fixes a few bugs 
reported by the community.

The API has also now been fully documented. It is in 2 parts: the API documentation which is available on our 
help website, and the [API reference](https://api-reference.passbolt.com/) which is built directly from the 
[open api](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_openapi_specs) specifications files.

Some dependencies have also been updated including jQuery, in regards to the latest security issues.
